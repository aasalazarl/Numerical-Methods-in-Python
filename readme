01 Problems with numerical derivatives

02 Numerical integration of the Earth's orbit around the sun: calculation 
of the eccentricity of the orbit and the time of perihelion and aphelion over 
a determined period of time

03 Atmospheric data analysis: 1) max and min temperatures as a function of date 
for weather stations 2) histogram of max and min temperatures for a weather station 
3) overlapping data from two weather stations into a mean and standard deviation 
4) 2D color histogram for differing measurements between two stations 
5) no-atmosphere model of heating and cooling (looking at the solar flux on earth 
assuming that there is no atmosphere)

04 Ordinary differential eigenvalue problems for the hydrogen atom problem in Quantum Mechanics

05 A simple Monte Carlo simulation to calculate diffusion of a single argon atom in argon gas. 
Tasks: 1) calculation of the number of collisions/second 
2) plotting of the distance from the origin the atom travels as a function of time 
3) calculation of the energy distribution of the particle as it bounces
